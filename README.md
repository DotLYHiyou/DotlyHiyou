  <h1>About Me:</h1>
<p align="center">
  
  I like coding and playing Roblox asyms. I also like to learn about new stuff and toy around with things. I only really work on unblocked games stuff In terms of actual projects, but I'm learning to become a fullstack javascript developer.

Quick note about me: I tend to change my pfp several times a month to a new Roblox Forsaken related image. This is cuz I have a crippling addiction with Roblox Forsaken and Roblox Asymmetrical Horror games. I'm constantly trying to find a PFP to stick to.

<h2>My Thoughts on The Forsaken Controversies</h2>
<p>As an avid player with 12+ days of playtime, I personally can't stop playing Forsaken despite countless times with the dev team showing they seriously suck at running the game. From the whole Soul thing and the 25% situation, to ffprankster saying the n-word with no punishment and yuyu's whole ordeal within the Outcome Memories team (RIP OM), <b><em>I honestly can say I'm very disappointed in them as many others are.</em></b> But, I'll continue enjoying the game since playing it doesn't really make me as bad as them. </p>
<h3>THESE ARE JUST MY THOUGHTS, DON'T TALK ABOUT IT IN ANY OF MY PROJECTS OR DM ME ABOUT IT.</h3>
